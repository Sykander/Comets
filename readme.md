# Reaction Game

The game is built using html, css and javascript. The aim of the game is to last as long as possible without being hit by any of the falling comets.

For each comet you successfully avoid, your score will increase by 1, however the overall game difficulty increases as the score increases.

# Structure

The game is structured fairly simply, there is a 10 by 10 table with each cell of the table containing the appropriate sprite image. The cell classes are edited on a regular cycle to move the sprites around.
