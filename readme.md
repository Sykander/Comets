# Reaction Game

The game is built using html, css and javascript. The aim of the game is to progress through each sequence by hitting the appropriate keyboard key, when prompted by the on screen key display.

The timing of the key press will be expressed to you by the collapsing circle around the displayed key. The aim of the game is to continue through each sequence without failing to hit the correct keys, the timing will progressively get harder and harder the more sequences you go through. If you fail to hit a key at any point in the game then you will be diverted into a death animation and the game is over.

# structure

The game is structured by running the a specified function for each sequence which will then test for the input at each relevant stage of the animation. The game is also constantly running functions to determine if a key is being held down, if your key is held down during the window where the decision is made then you will pass the condition, otherwise it counts as a fail.

All code is written by myself, Sykander Gul, and also all images will be drawn by myself. At the moment, all the images in the game are stock images from google which will be replaced at a later date.
